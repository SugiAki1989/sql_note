## :memo: Overview

ここではサッカーの勝敗表から勝ち点を計算する SQL をまとめる。

サンプルデータを用意する。各行は、2 つの異なるチーム間の試合記録で、試合に勝てば 3 点、引き合わけは 1 点、負けは 0 点として勝点を計算する。

```sql
create table football(match_id int, home_team int, away_team int, home_goals int, away_goals int);
insert into football(match_id, home_team, away_team, home_goals, away_goals) values
('1','10','20','3','0'), -- 3 0
('3','10','50','5','1'), -- 3 0
('2','30','10','2','2'), -- 1 1
('4','20','30','1','0'), -- 3 0
('5','50','30','1','5'); -- 3 0
```

まずはホームチームの勝ち点、アウェイチームの勝点を計算する。

```sql
select
    match_id, home_team, away_team, home_goals, away_goals,
    case when home_goals > away_goals then 3
         when home_goals = away_goals then 1
         else 0 end as home_win_point,
    case when away_goals > home_goals then 3
         when home_goals = away_goals then 1
         else 0 end as away_win_point
from
    football;

 match_id | home_team | away_team | home_goals | away_goals | home_win_point | away_win_point
----------+-----------+-----------+------------+------------+----------------+----------------
        1 |        10 |        20 |          3 |          0 |              3 |              0
        3 |        10 |        50 |          5 |          1 |              3 |              0
        2 |        30 |        10 |          2 |          2 |              1 |              1
        4 |        20 |        30 |          1 |          0 |              3 |              0
        5 |        50 |        30 |          1 |          5 |              0 |              3
(5 rows)
```

これをホームとアウェイでテーブルを分割してユニオンすすれば、ほとんど完成。

```sql
with home as(
select
    home_team as team_id,
    case when home_goals > away_goals then 3
         when home_goals = away_goals then 1
         else 0 end as win_point
from football
), away as (
select
    away_team as team_id,
    case when away_goals > home_goals then 3
         when home_goals = away_goals then 1
         else 0 end as win_point
from football
)
select team_id, win_point from home
union all
select team_id, win_point from away
;

 team_id | win_point
---------+-----------
      10 |         3
      10 |         3
      30 |         1
      20 |         3
      50 |         0
      20 |         0
      50 |         0
      10 |         1
      30 |         0
      30 |         3
(10 rows)
```

あとはこれを合計すれば勝ち点が計算できる。

```sql
with home as(
select
    home_team as team_id,
    case when home_goals > away_goals then 3
         when home_goals = away_goals then 1
         else 0 end as win_point
from football
), away as (
select
    away_team as team_id,
    case when away_goals > home_goals then 3
         when home_goals = away_goals then 1
         else 0 end as win_point
from football
)
select team_id, sum(win_point) as win_point
from
(select team_id, win_point from home
union all
select team_id, win_point from away
) as a
group by team_id
order by win_point desc;
```
